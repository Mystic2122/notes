\section*{Example 1}
Suppose you are watching an NBA game. You estimate that each team scores 1 field goal every minute on average. You want to know the probability that there are no field goals made during the first 6 minutes of the game. \\
This is a \textbf{poisson process} with a rate of $\lambda = 1$ and amount of time $t=6$. Let $X$ be a random variable that represents the number of field goals made by a team after $t$ time intervals. \\
We can model this process like this:
\begin{align*}
Prob(X=0,t=6) = \frac{1^0 e^{-6*1}}{0!} 
	= e^{-6} 
	\approx 0.00248
\end{align*}
Now to get the porbability of both teams not score we just square the probability of one team not scoring.\\
\\
\boxed{Final Answer: 0.00000614}
